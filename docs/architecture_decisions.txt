1. The front-end app will talk to connection microservice to get each individual person's connections via restful api
2. The front-end app will talk to person microservice to get the list of all person to initial the frond-end data via restful api
3. The connection svc will directly talk to database to retrieve the connections info based on the request
4. Each person's mobile device will be sending their location to Location Ingest Microservice, as this will be high volume traffic, so I decided to 
   use GRPC protocol due to its high performace attribute
5. Location Ingst Microservice will forward the ingested location data to kafka message queue
6. There is another Location sink microservice to connect to kafka cluster to read the data in kafka and saved them into database
